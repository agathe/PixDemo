# Notes

- MVVM
Model View View Model is a variation over MVC that enforces a better separation of concerns.
View Controllers have a View Model that is passed to them upon creation (as I used storyboards here,
the VM is passed after its instanciation). This VM is in charge of pulling and managing the
required data.

- Swift alternative to KVO
Reacting to events is common to any software program. Doing so in an elegant way can be
tedious (delegates) or lead to confusing code (notifications). KVO in Objective-C enabled
very nice abstractions for reacting to events. KVO is not the Swift way, and programmers
have come with alternatives. I am reusing such an alternative and have borrowed code to do so.
It consists in defining an 'obversable' property and adding a callback when that property changes.

- Filtering
I did not find any elegant way of handling the filtering based on a search term on the title.
Typically, such a feature is best handled on the API side by providing a query term, e.g. ?q=search_term
Filtering the photos on the client side lead to ineffiency (potentially loading images that will never
be used because filtered out) and complexity (dealing with 2 sets of data, one filtered, the other not)
To avoid writing code I would not liked, I elected to do this: the title-based filtering would operate
on 1 page of photos and no more loading of photos would be allowed (no infinited scrolling when searching).


# Next improvements

- API service
I would typically separate all methods dealing with calling a 3rd party service into its own
set of classes. Here, I've taken the shortcut of doing it in the MV.

- Image caching
There are plenty of nice libraries that deal with image caching. I would use one to avoid
reloading the image every time it's shown.
